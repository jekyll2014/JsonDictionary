# JsonDictionary
MetaUI source processor to ease samples search

It's intended to ease sample search. As Kinetic manuals are poor for now there are many cases we need to search through the existing projects to find the example.
The tool collects database of the fields and values of the project .jsonc files and one can search the needed parameter/keyword in the tree to see the examples of use.
I've started the project only 3 evenings ago so there is lot to do but it does some job already. Some guys here in Moscow team hope it'll be of some use.
Read quick note inside for use tips.
